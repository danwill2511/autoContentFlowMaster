# AutoContentFlow Development Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for building AutoContentFlow, an AI-powered content management and automation platform. Each section includes the necessary prompts for AI assistance.

## üöÄ Phase 1: Project Setup

### 1. Initial Project Structure

We'll use the Expo Remix template for faster development and better mobile integration:

```bash
# AI Prompt: "Initialize project using Expo Remix template with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS"

# Create project with Expo Remix template
npx create-expo-app@latest -e with-remix

Project structure:
/app
  /routes         # Route components
  /components     # Shared components
  /hooks          # Custom hooks
  /utils          # Utility functions
/assets          # Static assets
/server          # Backend services
/tests           # Test files
```

The Expo Remix template provides:
- Pre-configured TypeScript setup
- Built-in mobile-first routing
- Unified codebase for web and mobile
- Automatic platform-specific optimizations
- Hot module replacement
- Built-in support for native APIs

### 2. Dependencies Setup
```bash
# AI Prompt: "Set up core dependencies for AutoContentFlow including React, Express, OpenAI, PayPal integration"

Key packages:
- React & Next.js
- Express
- OpenAI SDK
- PayPal SDK
- React Navigation (mobile)
- Winston (logging)
- Redis (caching)
```
