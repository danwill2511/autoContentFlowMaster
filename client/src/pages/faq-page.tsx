    faqs: [
      {
        question: "How does the AI content generation work?",
        answer: "Our AI content generation uses advanced language models (powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o) to create content based on your specified parameters such as topic, tone, content type, and target platforms. The AI analyzes your inputs, current trends, and best practices to generate relevant, engaging content tailored to your needs."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I edit the AI-generated content?",
        answer: "Absolutely! All AI-generated content is fully editable. We recommend reviewing and personalizing the content before publishing to ensure it aligns perfectly with your brand voice and objectives."
      },
      {
        question: "Is there a limit to how much content I can generate?",
        answer: "Content generation limits vary based on your subscription tier. Free accounts can generate a limited number of pieces per month, while paid tiers offer progressively higher limits. You can view your current usage and limits in your account dashboard."

        question: "How does AutoContentFlow ensure the content is original?",
        answer: "Our AI is designed to generate unique content based on your inputs. While the model draws from its training data, it creates new content rather than copying existing materials. We also have built-in originality checks to ensure freshness and uniqueness."

      },
      {
        question: "How do I create a workflow?",
        answer: "Navigate to the Workflows section, click 'Create New Workflow', and follow the step-by-step guide to define your content parameters, select platforms, set scheduling preferences, and configure any additional automations like approval steps or performance tracking."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use different schedules for different platforms?",
        answer: "Yes! Each platform within a workflow can have its own unique scheduling settings. This allows you to optimize posting times based on when your audience is most active on each platform."
      },
      {
        question: "Is there a limit to how many workflows I can create?",
        answer: "The number of workflows you can create depends on your subscription tier. Free users can create up to 3 workflows, while higher tiers allow for more. Check your subscription details for specific limits."
      },
      {
        question: "Can workflows be paused or modified?",
        answer: "Yes, workflows can be paused, resumed, or modified at any time. Changes to active workflows will apply to future content generation and publishing, not to already scheduled posts."

    faqs: [

Pro and Business tiers get access to more advanced analytics including sentiment analysis and competitor benchmarking."
      },
      {
        question: "How frequently is analytics data updated?",

      {
        question: "How does the posting time optimizer work?",

      },
      {
        question: "Can I set up custom alerts based on analytics?",
        answer: "Yes, Pro and Business subscribers can configure custom alerts based on performance thresholds. For example, you can receive notifications when a post exceeds certain engagement levels or when performance drops below expected metrics."
